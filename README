== Vignette

Vignette is a platform for short, insightful, and beautiful data storytelling. The tool empowers users to weave narrative, data visualization, mapping, social media, and other content together into a single interactive online document. This empowers researchers, journalists, and planners to create a singular "masthead" document that directs audiences to their work. With a low barrier to entry, this tool makes it easy to attract online audiences to projects, especially when projects budgets are too small to warrant a web presence.
